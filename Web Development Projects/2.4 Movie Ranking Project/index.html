<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
I can't really remember why. I haven't seen it in years and should watch again.

<h3>Aladdin</h3>
<p>A Whole New World is my favorite Disney song, and I used to watch this movie just to sing it.</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>
 Anytime I need a good cry, I watch the Notebook
